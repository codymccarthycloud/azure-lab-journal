# Working with Variables and Pipelines in Azure PowerShell

This hands-on lab walks through the use of variables and pipelines in Azure PowerShell via the Azure Cloud Shell. 
Youâ€™ll filter and manipulate Azure resources with PowerShell and prepare automation scripts suitable for CI/CD workflows.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use variables to store data and results
- Apply pipelines for chaining commands
- Filter Azure resources based on Kind, Location, etc.
- Link PowerShell logic to Azure DevOps CD pipelines

---

## Step 1: Define Variables

Variables store data or command output so it can be reused or filtered.

### List All Azure Resources
```powershell
$Resources = Get-AzResource
$Today = (Get-Date).DateTime

$Resources | Format-List

$Resources | Where-Object {$_.Kind -eq 'Storage'}

$Resources | Where-Object {$_.Kind -notlike 'Storage'}

$Resources | Where-Object {$_.Location -eq 'westus'}

$Resources | Select-Object Name, Location
```

---

## CI/CD Relevance

PowerShell automation using variables and pipelines is often used in CD pipelines to:
- Provision infrastructure
- Apply filters before actions
- Monitor cost
- Tag and organize resources

```Yaml
- task: AzurePowerShell@5
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'MyConnection'
    ScriptType: 'InlineScript'
    Inline: |
      $Resources = Get-AzResource
      $StorageResources = $Resources | Where-Object { $_.Kind -eq 'Storage' }
      $StorageResources | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.Name }
    pwsh: true
```
