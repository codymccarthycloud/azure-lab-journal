# Limit Access to Azure Storage Account Using SAS URI

## Prepare Testing Environment
- Log in to the Azure Portal using lab credentials in **Incognito mode**.
- Connect to the pre-provisioned VM via **RDP**:
  - **Username**: `cloud_user`
  - **Password**: *(from lab credentials)*
- Launch **Azure Storage Explorer** on the VM.
- Choose **Attach to a resource > Storage account or service > Shared access signature URL (SAS)**.
- Leave the connection dialog open and minimize the VM.

## Create Storage Container and Upload Files
- In the Azure Portal, navigate to the storage account (starts with `pslab`).
- Go to **Data storage > Containers**.
- Create a new container named `container1`.
- Upload two sample `.txt` files to the container.

## Generate SAS Token
- In the storage account, go to **Settings > Configuration**.
- Enable **Allow storage account key access** and click **Save**.
- Navigate to **Security + networking > Shared access signature**.
- Configure the SAS token:
  - **Allowed services**: Blob
  - **Allowed resource types**: Service, Container, Object
  - **Allowed permissions**: Read, List
  - **Allowed protocols**: HTTPS only
- Click **Generate SAS and connection string**.
- Copy the **Blob service SAS URL** and save it securely.

## Test SAS-Based Access
- Return to the VM and paste the SAS URL into Storage Explorer.
- Connect and verify `MyLabCnx` appears in the Explorer pane.
- Navigate to `container1` and confirm the two uploaded files are visible.
- Attempt to delete a file â€” the action should **fail**, confirming limited permissions.

---

## Observations

- SAS tokens provide fine-grained, time-bound access to storage resources.
- Read/List permissions worked as expected; delete operations were blocked.
- Using Storage Explorer with SAS is ideal for secure, scoped access without exposing account keys.

---

## Completion Notes

- Successfully created and tested a SAS token for Azure Blob Storage.
- Verified permission boundaries using Azure Storage Explorer.
- Demonstrated secure access control without full account credentials.

Tip: Always restrict SAS tokens to the minimum required permissions and set expiration dates to reduce security risks.
